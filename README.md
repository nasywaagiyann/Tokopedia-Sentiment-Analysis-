# üìä Sentiment Analysis on Tokopedia App Reviews

This project performs sentiment analysis on user reviews of the Tokopedia application by using both Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques.

---

## üì• Data Collection & Cleaning

- **Source**: User reviews scraped from the Tokopedia app on Google Play Store using `google-play-scraper`.
- **Initial Cleaning**:
  - Removed missing values
  - Removed duplicate entries

---

## üßπ Text Preprocessing

To standardize the input and improve model performance, the following preprocessing steps were applied:

- Convert text to lowercase  
- Remove numbers  
- Remove punctuation  
- Remove extra whitespaces  
- Tokenize text into words  
- Remove stopwords (using `stopwordbahasa.csv`)  
- Normalize slang using `new_kamusalay.csv`

These steps ensure cleaner and more consistent input for vectorization using either **TF-IDF** or **Tokenizer**.

## üß† Models and Performance

Four different models were trained and evaluated on the same dataset:

### 1. **Random Forest (TF-IDF)**
- **Train Accuracy**: 98.49%  
- **Test Accuracy**: 87.77%  
- Very strong performance on training data; slightly lower test accuracy compared to SVM.

### 2. **DNN (TF-IDF)**
- **Train Accuracy**: 97.99%  
- **Test Accuracy**: 87.88%  
- Stable and balanced performance across both training and test datasets.

### 3. **BiLSTM (Tokenizer)**
- **Train Accuracy**: 95.77%  
- **Test Accuracy**: 86.89%  
- Good performance overall, especially on sequential data; test accuracy slightly lower than other models.

### 4. **SVM (TF-IDF)**
- **Train Accuracy**: 93.23%  
- **Test Accuracy**: 89.11%  
- Highest test accuracy among all models; best generalization on unseen data.

## ‚úÖ Final Conclusion

- **Best for generalization**: **SVM (TF-IDF)** ‚Äì highest test accuracy  
- **Best fit to training data**: **Random Forest (TF-IDF)**  
- **Most balanced and stable**: **DNN (TF-IDF)**  
- **For sequential data**: **BiLSTM (Tokenizer)**

> The best model depends on the specific objective: whether prioritizing prediction accuracy, model strength, or generalization capability.
